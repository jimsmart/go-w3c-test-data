# N3 Grammars

This work was greatly aided by [≈Åukasz' work on an initial N3 grammar](https://github.com/lszeremeta/n3).

Since N3 is supposed to subsume Turtle, we started by creating a grammar for Turtle (`turtle.g4`).
In and of itself this came with its own set of issues - see comments in the grammar file.

The Turtle grammar was subsequently adapted and extended with N3 constructs (`n3.g4`).

Changes between the new N3 grammar and the original grammars (Turtle, N3) include:
- Dropping the `@keywords` section
- "Verb" keywords (e.g., `is .. of`, `has`) can only be used without `@` prefix. This was because of conflicts with some language tags (e.g., `@is` for Icelandic).
- Allowing inverted properties at the start of path (e.g., `:s <-:p :o`)
- On top of the grammar, a visitor object checks whether prefixes in `prefixedNames` have been declared
- Supporting comments in files  
(strangely, neither N3 nor Turtle seemed to define these in their syntaxes)

To re-create the HTML grammar from the EBNF file, run the following:
- gem install ebnf
- rake

# Testing

For testing, we are currently using the [Turtle test suite](https://www.w3.org/2013/TurtleTests/), the [Eye N3 test cases](http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/), and [cwm N3 test cases](https://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm.html). 
A number of tests were also contributed by [Gregg Kellogg](https://github.com/gkellogg) as distilled from the [SWAP webpage](http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap). 

All tests can be found under the `tests/` folder, where each subfolder (`N3Tests`, `TurtleTests`) has its own `manifest.ttl` file that describe the test cases (e.g., positive, negative tests) using the [RDF test manifest](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-testcases/) vocabulary.

Since running syntax tests is a bit more complex than usual, with a distinction between positive- and negative-tests 
(i.e., tests with and without expected syntax errors), we opted to create our own "test harnass" (see [here](https://github.com/w3c/N3/blob/master/grammar/src/main/java/test/) for the code).

See below for instructions on how to run the tests.

## Running tests

Currently, the test harnass supports:
- The new N3 (and Turtle) grammar (see `*.g4` files)
- The [cwm](https://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm.html) system.
- The [eye](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph/special_issues/Smart_Healthcare_Services) system.

It should be relatively straightforward to support additional systems, when they are developed.

The tool will utilize a `manifest.ttl` file when found (or when indicated using the `-mf` flag); else, it will treat all given files as positive/negative tests. It will also print all output to file `./test_out.txt`, in addition to showing it on the cmd line.

To compile the test harness, run `mvn clean package`. If all goes well this process should result in separate jar files for each supported system under the `target` folder. Note that you can update the grammar (`.g4` file) and then run `mvn clean package` to compile the new lexer and parser, which are part of the test harness.

Run `java -jar <name>.jar` for usage info. Below, the options are described in a bit more detail.

There is a distinction between **positive-tests** (i.e., no syntax errors expected) and **negative-tests** (i.e., syntax errors expected).

- In case a **folder** is given, the program will look for a `manifest.ttl` file that describe the test cases using the [RDF test manifest](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-testcases/) vocabulary. Optionally, you can indicate the manifest file using the `-mf` flag.

When no manifest is found or given, the program will treat all Turtle / N3 files in the folder as tests (recursively). The program will expect a `-pos`/`-neg` flag indicating whether they are positive or negative tests. Note that this flag can also be given to override the `manifest.ttl` file within the folder, if any.

- In case an **individual file** is given, the program will always expect a `-pos`/`-neg` flag to indicate whether it is a  positive or negative test. The `-printAST` flag can be added to print the parsed AST.

For instance:

* `java -jar n3TestGrammar.jar n3 ../tests/N3Tests`  
**N3**: tests files inside the `N3Tests` folder, as listed in its `manifest.ttl`, as N3 test cases.  

* `java -jar n3TestGrammar.jar n3 ../tests/N3Tests -mf manifest.n3`  
**N3**: tests files inside the `N3Tests` folder, as listed in its `manifest.n3`, as N3 test cases.  

* `java -jar n3TestGrammar.jar n3 ../tests/TurtleTests -pos`  
**Turtle**: tests all files inside the `TurtleTests` folder as positive Turtle test cases.

* `java -jar n3TestGrammar.jar n3 ../tests/N3Tests/01etc/food-query.n3 -pos -printAST`  
**N3**: tests the `a.n3` file as a positive N3 test case and prints its AST.

* `java -jar n3TestCwm.jar C:/cwm/cwm-1.2.1/build/scripts-2.7/cwm ../tests/N3Tests`  
**Cwm**: tests files inside the `N3Tests` folder, as listed in its `manifest.ttl`, as cwm test cases.

* `java -jar n3TestEye.jar C:/eye/eye.cmd ../tests/N3Tests`  
**Eye**: tests files inside the `N3Tests` folder, as listed in its `manifest.ttl`, as eye test cases.

### Turtle grammar

For the **Turtle test suite**, the Turtle grammar fails for two negative-test files (marked as `Rejected` in `manifest.ttl`) due to an issue unrelated to the parser.

### N3 grammar

Currently, the new N3 grammar does not support the `@keywords` section. This means that quite a lot of relevant test cases, i.e., which are meant to test something else but happen to have a `@keywords` section, were failing. Hence, we manually removed the `@keywords` section and manually corrected the non-qname terms in those files. You can find the original versions of those test cases in the `N3Tests/original/with_keywords` folder. 

Note that the `N3Tests\turtle` folder contains test cases from the Turtle test suite that specifically target N3 features (so they are expected to fail for a Turtle-only parser, but should succeed for an N3 parser).

We refer to the `manifest.ttl` file for all test cases that failed for our N3 grammar - these will have a `Rejected` or `Proposed` approval together with an `rdfs:comment` describing why they failed.

## JavaScript

Since we are using ANTLR4, we can easily generate JavaScript lexer, parser and visitor code as well.

Based on the JS lexer and parser, we created the [n3-editor-js](https://github.com/william-vw/n3-editor-js) project which features lint (i.e., error flagging) support for Notation3, among others.

### Creating the JS parser

To generate the JavaScript parser code, download the latest [ANTLR4 runtime](https://www.antlr.org/download.html) and run:

`java -jar path/to/antlr-<version>-complete.jar -Dlanguage=JavaScript n3.g4 -visitor`

- Ensure there are no "package" statements at the start of the lexer and parser files
- Add the "symbolicNames" variable as a parser property (e.g., `n3Parser.symbolicNames = symbolicNames;`) 

You can then create an `index.js` page for testing the JS parser (and possibly your own visitor code). You should use `npm` for running the code. See [here](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/javascript-target.md) for more information.

Then, you can package all of the code into a single JS file so it can be included into a webpage:

- Install `webpack` for `npm` (see [here](https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/#local-installation))
  
- Create a `webpack.config.js` file (see N3 editor's [`webpack.config.js`](https://github.com/william-vw/n3-editor-js/blob/master/editor/webpack.config.js) for an example)  

- Run the following: `npx webpack --config webpack.config.js`  
*NB*: set `minimize` to `false` for easier debugging
